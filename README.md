## What is LunaSec?

LunaSec is an end-to-end security system designed to protect your application by transparently encrypting sensitive
data, from browser to database. It works seamlessly by storing your sensitive data and then giving you back a Token (a UUID) to retrieve data with
later. Tokens aren't sensitive values by themselves, thereby limiting the impact of security issues in your application
when exposed, and also provide the foundation that LunaSec builds on to offer you additional security and compliance
features.

### Features

- **Secure By Default**: Prevents data leaks by making your software resistant
  to [many security issues](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/security/vulns-and-mitigations/) like SQL
  Injection, XSS, and even RCE.
- **Best-In-Class Compliance Software**: Decrease your compliance overhead by 90%+ with centralized *access control
  logic*, *audit logs*, and *automatic compliance validation*.
- **Simple Onboarding**: [Get started in minutes](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/example-usage/) by adding *
  only a few lines of code* anywhere that sensitive data enters or exits your system.
- **Built By Security Experts**: Designed to bring leading security practices to your applications *without requiring
  advanced security knowledge*.
- **Self-Hosted And Open**: You retain control over your data by hosting LunaSec yourself. It's open source software
  licensed under a permissive Apache2.0 license.
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: All records
  are [encrypted with a unique key](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/security/encryption/) that even LunaSec
  can't access. Decryption only happens when you need it to.
- **Scales Automatically**: Supports even the largest loads by leveraging cloud-scale database services like AWS S3 and
  DynamoDB.
- **Enterprise Grade**: We offer warranties, managed deployments, and custom support via
  our [Premium Support packages](#custom-support-from-the-lunasec-team).

You can read more [here](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/features/) about what features LunaSec provides.

## Live Demo
You can try it out LunaSec with one command **if you have Node and Docker installed**:

```
npx @lunasec/cli start --env demo
```

That will pull all the Docker containers and start the LunaSec demo app on your computer. It's a simple web app that you
can play with in your browser. There are a lot of containers to run, so it may take a few minutes to finish starting up.

Once it's running, just sign up for a new account and then submit some fake data in the app. (It's a fake account that's
on your computer only)

All data in the app is transparently encrypted and stored in the LunaSec database in the app. Take a look at the
elements on the page and the network requests to view how it's all working.

For a deeper dive into the Demo App, please see
this [page](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/demo-app/walkthrough/) for a walkthrough of everything. All the
source code is available [here](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/tree/master/js/demo-apps/packages) for you to
view.

## System Architecture
LunaSec works across the components of your web stack to provide end-to-end data security.
We've documented the components of the stack [here](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/features/) and in the diagram below.

![LunaSec Architecture Diagram](docs/static/img/security-model-overview.svg)

## Who is LunaSec for?
LunaSec is designed to be used by anybody that needs to store sensitive text for files in a production web application.
Despite being built by Security Engineers, **LunaSec does not require security expertise to get started**.
It's designed to be used by ordinary Software Engineers and Developers.

Reasons to use LunaSec:
- **Security & Data Privacy Compliance**: [GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) defines sensitive data include
  Name, Email, Phone Number, IP Address, Credit Cards, and [more](https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/personal-data/#Examples_of_Personal_Information).
  If you are subject to data privacy regulations and store any of that data, then LunaSec will help you achieve compliance more easily.
- **Data Leak Protection**: If you store data that needs to remain securely stored and private, then LunaSec will greatly
  increase your defenses against unauthorized data leaks.
- **Data Inventory**: The centralized nature of LunaSec makes it easy to track and monitor what data you're storing,
  who and when it's used, and help you enforce access controls around that data.

The LunaSec stack spans from the front-end to the back-end of your application and works alongside your existing code to
keep your data encrypted and secure. To get started, please check out the steps below (["Trying LunaSec in 1 minute"](#trying-lunasec-in-1-minute)).

## How does LunaSec work?
LunaSec is similar to a [safety deposit box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_deposit_box) that holds your sensitive data. 
Each piece of data gets a unique box, a unique key to unlock it, and a unique number to identify each box by. These 
boxes are then securely stored inside a bank vault that only a banker with special permissions has access to. 
Accessing the box requires proof of ownership and the key to unlock the box. 

The boxes that the data is stored in are unable to be opened without the key. That means that even if the bank is evil, 
they can't open the box. Even if the box is stolen by a thief, the thief can't open the box without the keys. Only you 
are able to open the box.

Even if a thief steals the keys, they still have to get access the box either through the banker or by breaking into the
bank. One is useless without the other.

That's the core value that LunaSec provides for you. LunaSec runs the bank, hires the bankers, and keeps your boxes 
secure. You just have to provide the data and keep track of the keys to access it.

We've designed LunaSec to mitigate many common security vulnerabilities that developers face. Each component of the 
LunaSec stack is designed to provide protection against specific attack scenarios. Please read more about the security 
of LunaSec [here](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/security/levels/).

## Custom Support from the LunaSec Team
We offer paid support, onboarding, and additional enterprise features for LunaSec to help you reach your security or 
compliance milestones faster. Our team of security engineers is very flexible and happy to work with you. 

If you're interested, [please send us a message](https://www.lunasec.io/contact).

## Deploying LunaSec
In order to use LunaSec in your production environment, you will need to host a copy yourself. We have made available a
deployment CLI tool to make this task easier. Currently, only AWS is support. You don't need to use AWS for your application
to use LunaSec, however. You just need to have an AWS account for LunaSec to deploy to. (LunaSec will work with any app running anywhere)

To get started deploying LunaSec, please see our docs [here](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/deployment/deploy-with-aws/).

## Need Help?
If you find yourself stuck, you're missing a feature, or you just want to clear up some confusion, then please head over
to our [GitHub Discussions board](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/discussions) to talk with our team.

We're a small team and our resources are limited for how much assistance we've able to provide. 
If your needs are urgent, or you would like us to review your code/implementation, then please consider [inquiring about our custom support packages](#custom-support-from-the-lunasec-team).

## What's in this Repo?
This repo contains all public LunaSec code: the LunaSec SDKs, backend services, demo applications, documentation, and supporting scripts.

# MonoRepo Folder Structure
We have split code first by language, and then by purpose.

Our backend services and CLI tools are all written in Golang and live in `/go`.

Our web components and NPM modules are all written in TypeScript and live in `/js/sdks/packages`.

Our Demo Apps are also written in typescript and live in `/js/demo-apps/packages`.

Docs live in `docs`, and the OpenAPI Spec for our internal REST API lives in `api-spec`.

### Demo Apps
Path: `/js/demo-apps/packages`

Demo apps that use our toolkit for testing and demonstration.  The react-app and node-app are the one's currently being developed. 
These are our only SDK supported frameworks currently.

### TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs
Path: `/js/sdks/packages`

Contains front and backend SDKs.

They're all written in Typescript and outputs to a few different formats:
- ES5 build (polyfills ES2016 modules)
- ESNext build (uses ES2016 modules)
- Browser build (concatenated into one file that's loaded into browser global namespace)

### Secure Frame Front-End
Path: `/js/sdks/packages/secure-frame-iframe`

This holds the SDK frontend components which load into the iframe. The React SDK uses this to isolate sensitive data 
from front-end apps by using the iframe as an isolated "sandbox". We've hardened this iFrame by adding a very strict 
Content Security Policy (CSP) that limits the impact of any security issues by heavily restricting network access.

### Tokenizer, Secure Frame Back-End, and CLI
Path: `/go`

These are the back-end components of the LunaSec stack. They share a common codebase and are built into separate binaries
by the entrypoints defined in the `/go/cmd` folder, the most important being the `tokenizerbackend`.

You can build each entrypoint by using the Makefile like: `make tokenizerbackend` and then invoking the generated binary 
inside of the `build` folder like: `./build/tokenizerbackend_dev`.

# Contributing
Please read our [contributor instructions](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec-monorepo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
before forking and submitting a pull request.  It's short and it's very helpful if you're going to be working on LunaSec.

## How to launch LunaSec for development
To launch and use LunaSec to help you develop your application, see the documentation.  To work on LunaSec itself, follow these steps:

Install all dependencies by running `lerna bootstrap` and be patient.

Configure the LunaSec CLI tool to be used locally by running `yarn run lunasec:setup`. The `lunasec` command will not be accessible on your path.

Then, install `tmuxp` and run `tmuxp load ./start-with-tmuxp.yaml` in the root directory. 
You can inspect that file to see what commands are all being run if you'd like to start the cluster without tmuxp.

_Note: You'll have to provide your password for the `./go/scripts/start-tokenizerbackend-dependencies.sh` command to start._

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the demo application.

When you want to shut down the cluster, hit `ctrl+b` and type `:kill-session`. (It's just tmux)

### Using the CLI to generate test data
A CLI has been written in go to enable the creation of test data. Build the cli via:
```shell
cd go
make tokenizer tag=cli
```

and use it by running 
```shell
./build/tokenizer_cli COMMAND
```

### How to manage and install packages
We use Lerna to manage the monorepo, and we use yarn as the package manager.
Because yarn doesn't know about local packages like Lerna, we can't use `yarn add` to install dependencies. 
To add a dependency to a package, either edit it manually into the `package.json` and run `lerna bootstrap`, 
or use `lerna add <dependencyname> <path/to/package/youre/working/on>`.

## Our API spec and OpenAPI

Our Tokenizer API is defined by the OpenAPI standard (previously named Swagger) and can be found in the folder `/api-spec` in the project root.
If the spec changes, the generated code that relies on the spec will need to be regenerated. 
For example, in the tokenizer-sdk package, run `yarn openapi:generate` to regenerate the API client.
A similar pattern can be used (check the package.json) to generate an api client in any language you wish, 
by simply specifying the OpenAPI generator name when calling the `openapi-generator` NPM package .

## Feedback
Our goal is to build a sustainable business to support LunaSec and finding the right balance to enable us to build a
community while also enabling our business is our primary motivation. If you have thoughts on how we can improve our
approach, we would love to hear from you.

Please send us an email at developer-feedback at lunasec dot io *or* file an issue on this repository.

## Release Process
The release process will be handled automatically by our CI/CD system.   

Under the hood, the release process is split up into four parts:
1. Version bump
1. Compile artifacts
1. Publish artifacts
1. Push version tag to repository

Breaking this process up ensures that every part completes without error before moving onto the next step. This greatly reduces the event that some artifacts get published and others do not, leading to a headache of a time debugging a release.

Deployment of the releases is done by Github Actions.
## Version
Versioning for releases is done by lerna.
## Compile
Since the monorepo has both go and node code, compilation happens in multiple places. For the node sdks, every package has their own compilation package.json script which gets run. The entrypoint which calls into each package’s script is here. For the go code, all compilation code exists within the Makefile under the release target.
## Publish
For node artifacts, everything is handled by lerna. For go, publishing is handled by the publish target of the Makefile. Artifacts end up in NPM, DockerHub, and Github.
## Push
The version tag that gets pushed contains the version changes for the bumped monorepo version. Here is an example commit.
