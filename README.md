# Our Software

We're a team of Security Engineers on a mission to make awesome Open Source Application Security tooling. It all lives
in this repo. Here's a breakdown of everything we've built.

- **[LunaTrace](./lunatrace)**: A free alternative to services like GitHub Dependabot or [Snyk](https://snyk.io) that 
automatically monitors for your dependencies for vulnerabilities. It automatically integrates with GitHub Pull Requests
to notify you of new CVEs _before_ you deploy to production. Try it out in one-click via our [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/lunatrace-by-lunasec/). 
    - **Status**: Production ready and under active development (our primary focus).
- **[LunaDefend](./lunadefend)**: An end-to-end suite of security software built 
 around Tokenization designed to _proactively_ protect your sensitive data from being hacked, as well as providing an 
 easier path towards compliance (SOC2, GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc).
    - **Status**: Production ready and maintained (our secondary focus).
- **[Log4Shell CLI](./tools/log4shell)**: A small command line utility to scan for Log4Shell. Also supports patching JAR files against
  Log4Shell, scanning running processes on your system, and more. Follow our
  [Mitigation Guide](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide/) for more context.
    - **Status**: Production ready and used by thousands of companies. Superseded by LunaTrace.
- **[Our Security Blog](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/)**: Our ramblings to the internet. This is where we broke the news about the log4j vulnerability and gave it the name [Log4Shell](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/tags/log-4-shell).  The blog lives in this repo under `/docs/blog` if you feel 
 like contributing!

## Feedback
Our goal is to create a sustainable business to support LunaSec, while also building an Open Source community. If you have thoughts on how we can improve our
approach, we would love to hear from you.

Please email us at `developer-feedback at lunasec dot io` *or* file an issue on this repository.

## Release Process
The release process will be handled automatically by our CI/CD system.   

Under the hood, the release process is split up into four parts:
1. Version bump
1. Compile artifacts
1. Publish artifacts
1. Push version tag to repository

Breaking this process up ensures that every part completes without error before moving onto the next step. This greatly reduces the event that some artifacts get published and others do not, leading to a headache of a time debugging a release.

Deployment of the releases is done by GitHub Actions.
## Version
Versioning for releases is done by lerna.
## Compile
Since the monorepo has both go and node code, compilation happens in multiple places. For the node sdks, every package has their own compilation package.json script which gets run. The entrypoint which calls into each packageâ€™s script is here. For the go code, all compilation code exists within the Makefile under the release target.
## Publish
For node artifacts, everything is handled by lerna. For go, publishing is handled by the publish target of the Makefile. Artifacts end up in NPM, DockerHub, and Github.
## Push
The version tag that gets pushed contains the version changes for the bumped monorepo version. Here is an example commit.
