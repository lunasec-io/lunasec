Talking about patching vulnerabilities publicly on GitHub is one of the main ways that attackers find and exploit vulnerabilities
in Open Source software.  This is a step-by-step guide for Open Source maintainers on how to handle the process properly, using the Log4Shell incident as a case study.

### Things they don't teach you in school

As a "normal" developer who works alongside security engineers, I hear them mention all kinds of best practices that,
for the most part, I've never heard of.  It turns out that how to properly deal with vulnerabilities in a project you use or contribute to,
right down to what you say on GitHub, can be just as important as the patch itself.

log4j is a great case study because,
even though people had the best intentions, things went catastrophically wrong. At the core of the issue you have a couple of
developers donating their spare time doing their best. This is absolutely not
meant to be a hit piece against them or Open Source software, but instead a guide to help the next person handle things the right way.
Together, let's learn how to do this properly.

### Hackers are crawling GitHub looking for security patches

Patching vulnerabilities is great, and finding one and contributing a fix can be pretty exciting. But for a vulnerability to be patched,
one has to have first existed.  It's trivially easy to write a webcrawler that looks through GitHub for the words
"vulnerability", "security", "injection", "exploit", etc...
and find a package where the last version, if not the current one, has a vulnerability ready to be turned into an exploit.
Those crawlers are up and running _right now_, reading your comments and looking for the next 0-day. Let that sink in.

## It's about being discreet

### Reporting the vulnerability

How the vulnerability first gets reported is critical. In the case of log4j, contrary to what you might think,
it looks like everything went right. According to the log4shell [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell), the vulnerability was reported
*privately* to the apache team way back on November 24th by Chen Zhaojun of
Alibaba Cloud Security Team.

If you are someone spotting a vulnerability for the first time, this is exactly what you should do.
We can also see that Mitre site created the CVE, **in private**, two days later, november 26th.

Up until this point, it was security professionals following a well documented practice called [Responsible Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).  Let's move on to
what happened next:

### Patching the vulnerability

Often just the nature of the patch can alert those who know what to look for, even without
anyone spelling out that it's a vulnerability.

Let's look at the first [log4j PR](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/608).

![Pr header](/img/log4j-pr-header.png)

At first glance it doesn't look too bad, at least to an average dev.  Unfortunately, bad actors probably noticed this PR
almost right away.
Let's look at the files committed:

![exploit patch file name](/img/log4j-exploit-file.png)

In the PR, there is literally a file named `JndiExploit.java`. Even without using the word exploit, the word JNDI could
have been enough to attract bad actors.

Cat's out of the bag. It's almost certain this PR, made with the best intentions, made things far worse.

In the end, the vulnerability went public before log4j was ready to ship a fix, and they were left scrambling.
Their first release of version `2.15.0`, which much of the community installed, proved to still have issues.
They had to release a second patch in `2.16.0` which we seriously hope is seeing widespread adoption.

## How to do it right

### Step 1: Mitigate in private
Open source software is public, which means eventually the patch will need to be public.  We want that to happen
when we are as ready for it as possible, **not before**, so:

#### Make a private fork of your repo
Developers will need a private space to work on a patch and get ready before that happens.
This will give them space to make the change, prepare a release, and get documentation ready.

Ideally a security person will be brought into this private process to audit the change, if you can get one. Side note: We are considering
founding a non-profit to give people this help, and if that's something you'd like to see please [let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1yaB-3ob4yNnHBDzmFvrnl0VyViT234kpdcvadX-9G2M3eQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Once a release has been drafted, this is an excellent time to bring in some of your biggest users to try it out.  This has
the benefit of testing your patch, getting more eyes on the problem, and making sure those consumers have their
own patched releases ready to go. Let them know they should do this work in private.

In the case of Apache, the biggest users of log4j (like Apache Struts) should have been alerted privately. They could have
had their own privately prepared releases ready to go public when log4shell did.

In summary, doing it in private gives space and time to go through and fix things properly.

### Step 2: Release Simultaneously
Now it's time to rip the bandage off.  Publish all changes, releases, and documentation at the same time. Coordinate with any consumers
that took your change early.

Hopefully the documentation or press release contains all the information needed by users to patch the change, right away.
Generally, this is just explaining the vulnerability and pointing to the new release.

Making noise and getting the word out about the vulnerability is going to make for more people updating.
In the case of larger projects and more serious vulnerabilities, it might be a good idea to contact the press directly.
This can help you keep a handle on the reporting and let you control the narrative around how to fix it.

## Try to get everyone to follow this flow
Personally, I would recommend a short warning with the protocol to patch security problems in your Issue and Pull Request templates.
Ours looks like:

**STOP**: Is this a **security vulnerability**?  If so, follow Responsible Disclosure and email us at email@email.com instead of opening an issue.

It's not a bad idea to link to this blog post or the resources below if you are a security researcher reporting a vulnerability to a project.
Maybe if that had happened with log4j, it would have been handled differently.

## Other resources
* Google has compiled a little-known [comprehensive guide](https://github.com/google/oss-vulnerability-guide) on dealing with exactly these situations.
* OpenSSF has a [Vulnerability Disclosures Working Group](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures) that works to improve vulnerability disclosures in Open Source Software.

## That's it
These steps aren't that hard to follow, but they're different from the normal development flow of Open Source software.
This is common knowledge in security communities, but now we can say for sure that not every Open Source developer knows them.
Not everyone has a background in security, and that's okay. It's [our goal](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/) to make security
as easy and accessible as possible for everyday developers.
