Secure frame SDK

## Setup
```
# Run this from the same folder as the Readme (the root of the SDKs).
# Shared depenencies will automatically be resolved, which makes life much easier. :)
npm install

# This will symlink together all of the packages automatically for local dev
npx lerna link

# Compile everything via Typescript
npm run watch
```
