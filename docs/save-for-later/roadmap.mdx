### Future roadmap
#### Frontend
At the moment, LunaSec only fully supports React. Our Vue SDK is nearly done, and from there we will be making web-components that should
work with any framework.
#### Backend
NodeJS with either Express or Apollo-Graphql is our currently supported backend. We have an alpha Java SDK that will be finalized soon,
and we'd also like to add GoLang support. The API for backend service we call "The Tokenizer" is defined in an OpenAPI spec,
which means you can use the spec file and OpenAPI's generators to generate yourself a simple strongly typed tokenization
client in almost any language, even if we don't support it officially.
#### Dependence on AWS
We are using AWS specific tools pretty heavily. It's not necessary to have an entire app running on AWS,
just the LunaSec parts. This may still be too much Amazon for some users, and we are not great fans of lock-in, either.
There is a [massive community](https://github.com/guenter/aws-oss-alternatives) of Open Source projects that aim to be drop
in replacements for AWS tools. We'd like to give anyone using these tools the same first class support that we give
to normal AWS users.

### Funding and support
We're a Y-Combinator backed startup, and we offer paid support to install our tooling or modify it. We ask people to please let us
know if they need some help or changes! See our founder's post
[Building an Open Source Business](/blog/how-to-build-an-open-source-business-in-2021-part-1) to learn more about how we pay the bills
and make an Open Source business work.
