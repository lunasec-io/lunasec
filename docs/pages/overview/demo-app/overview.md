# Demo Applications

The demo applications show how to integrate LunaSec into a modern web application.  The frontend uses React with MaterialUi
and the backend server demonstrates both Express and GraphQL.

As you can see in the top right corner, the app can switch between several modes to test how LunaSec works with different systems.

## Running it
You can run it by cloning our repository and running `yarn start:demo`.  This will start the containers using docker-compose.
A local development copy of AWS will be used, so no credentials needed.  The demo app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  
Use the buttons in the top right corner if you would like to change the mode.

Please see [Code Walkthrough](/pages/overview/demo-app/walkthrough) for an explanation of how the demo app is structured.
