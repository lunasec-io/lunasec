# Apollo GraphQL Grants

Because we need to set and check Grants (LunaSec's token specific permissions), the server needs to know what fields are tokens.
We provide a schema directive to make this straightforward.  Behind the scenes, the directive calls the Dedicated Tokenizer.
If there is a problem with the session or the Grant, it will throw an error that Apollo will handle and send to the client.

### Automatically create and verify token grants for any field with the @token directive.

```typescript
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schemaDirectives: {token: lunaSec.tokenDirective}, // our initialized instance of the @lunasec/node-sdk
  // ... other apollo options
});
```
Here's an example schema that has the @token directive. Note that both input fields and normal fields should be decorated with the `@token` directive.  Don't forget to decorate every
field that contains a token, or it could be vulnerable.  Arrays of tokens are supported.
```graphql
const typeDefs = gql`
    directive @token(duration: String) on FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
    
    type Query {
        getFormData: FormData
    }
    
    type FormData {
        text_area: String @token(duration: "5m30s")
        email: String @token
        insecure_field: String
        files: [String] @token # @token directive also works on arrays of tokens
    }
    
    type Mutation {
     setFormData(formData: FormDataInput): FormData
    }
    
    input FormDataInput {
        email: String @token
        insecure_field: String
        text_area: String @token
        files: [String] @token
    }

`;
```

Passing a custom grant duration is optional, just make sure it is below the maximum set in your Tokenizer Backend's configuration.
