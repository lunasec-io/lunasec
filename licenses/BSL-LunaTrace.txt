Licensed Work:        LunaTrace 1.0
                      The Licensed Work is (c) 2022 Refinery Labs, Inc.
Additional Use Grant: Your company** may make production use*** of the Licensed Work, provided
                      you comply with all the following conditions:
                      1. Use of the software for the benefit of your company is use for a
                       permitted purpose if your company has fewer than 100 total individuals
                       working as employees and independent contractors, and less than
                       10,000,000 USD (2019) total revenue in the prior tax year. Adjust
                       this revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States
                       Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for all urban
                       consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted,
                       with 1982–1984=100 reference base.

                      2. Unless given explicit written permission by the LunaSec Team, via
                        emailing oss-licensing@lunasec.io, you may not disable analytics
                        reporting, and you must ensure that the LunaSec analytics server is
                        reachable by your deployed instances via the internet to successfully
                        upload analytics data to, and you must include the same unique
                        identifier across all of your instances so that your
                        usage may be effectively calculated by LunaSec****,

                      3. You may not remove the name, logo, copyright, or other branding
                        material from the Licensed Work to create a "rebranded"
                        or "white labeled" version to distribute as part of
                        any commercial or for-profit product or service.

                      4. You may not use the Licensed Work for a Hosting Service*****.

                      ** Your company is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other
                      kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that
                      have control over, are under the control of, or are under common
                      control with that organization. Control means ownership of
                      substantially all the assets of an entity, or the power to direct its
                      management and policies by vote, contract, or otherwise.
                      Control can be direct or indirect.

                      *** "Production Use" of the software is extended to include any
                      usage where data generated by the software is directly used to
                      achieve or maintain compliance with regulations or certifications
                      such as GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, CCPA, PCI-DSS, or similar; or where the
                      data generated by the software is used as part of a contractual
                      obligation, such as to provide evidence about security
                      vulnerabilities to a third party organization.

                      **** Analytics data uploaded to LunaSec will be anonymized
                      and used to calculate your usage, and will not include
                      information about specific vulnerabilities or packages in
                      any SBOMs.

                      ***** A “Hosting Service” is a commercial offering that
                      allows third parties (other than your employees and
                      contractors), even if it is provided free of charge,
                      to access the functionality of the Licensed Work by deploying
                      or scanning software artifacts whose source code, configuration
                      files, permissions management settings, or other schemas
                      are controlled by such third parties.
