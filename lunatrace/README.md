# LunaTrace

LunaTrace is a vulnerability scanner that tags and tracks inventories through to production deployment.  It combines static
analysis at build time with runtime tracking and the capability to automatically patch some high-profile vulnerabilities.

## Development
Hasura manages the GraphQl API and postgres database, found in the `./hasura` folder.
### Starting Hasura
Start hasura by running `sudo docker-compose up -d` from the hasura folder.  Run `hasura metadata apply` to transfer metadata
from local hasura folder into the running engine.  Then, migrate the database using `hasura migrate apply`.
This launches the graphql engine and a copy of postgres that volume mounts to your local postgres. 
### Using the Database
To use PSQL console or for connecting other services to the db, use the connection string found in the docker-compose.yaml file,
under the key `PG_DATABASE_URL`

#### Migrating the Database
Do **not** use the Hasura "console" GUI for managing the database, either creating tables or modifying them.  Hasura produces
low quality up migrations and broken down migrations that are not maintainable.  For pre-production, modify the existing init migration files.
For production migration, use `hasura migrate create <name>` to scaffold manual migrations.  

Use `hasura migrate apply --down 1` to do a down migration.

## Backend Data Ingestion
Backend services written in typescript can add data to postgres directly, bypassing Hasura when necessary.  These are found in the
`./backend` folder.  Run `yarn run vulnerabilities:update` from this folder to load the database with grype vulnerabilities.
