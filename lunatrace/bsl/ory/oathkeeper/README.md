# Oathkeeper

`./build-config.sh` will take the templates defined in `./templates/` and substitute their
defined environment variables. The resulting files will be written to `./generated/`.

## Production 
To add additional environment variables for oathkeeper in production, add them to `lunasec/lunatrace/bsl/backend-cdk/lib/lunatrace-backend-stack.ts`.

## Docker
When using docker-compose, oathkeeper will be intelligent enough to regenerate the config files on startup if the `/config` directory is mounted into the container.

## Local
```bash
# prod is used because it uses `localhost` to refer to resources which is needed if you are running outside of oathkeeper.
env $(xargs < .env) ./build-config.sh
oathkeeper --config generated/config.yaml serve
```
