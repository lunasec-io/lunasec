# LunaTrace Dev Setup

This is basically just going to be a collection of notes until we actually sit down to write this guide out better.

## System Requirements

- `docker`
- `docker-compose`
- `tmux`
- `tmuxp`
- `golang` (>=1.17)
- `node` (>=16)
- `yarn` (Just use `npm i -g yarn` if missing)
- Bash and other GNU utils (BSD utils are untested, i.e. Mac OSX)

## Dev Tools

We prefer IntelliJ by JetBrains and our dev configs are committed to the base of the repo under the `.idea` folder.

If you're using another IDE it'll probably work too because our workflows don't use the IDE a ton. We just use it for
stuff like auto-linting and various other quality of life tasks like easily navigating the codebase.

### AWS Credentials

In order to work with local dev, you'll have to have functional AWS credentials that the AWS CLI can find.

This exercise is left to you to sort out. Generally you'll need to put your credentials in `~/.aws/credentials` though.

## Repo setup

You'll have to clone the repo first and `cd` to it first.

### Setup Node Dependencies

Just run `yarn` from anywhere in the repo and it'll go sort out building deps. Otherwise, deps are committed to Git as
a part of the "Yarn PNP" flow. (You will not see a `node_modules` folder, only a `.yarn` one)

You'll also have to add `smee` to your path with:

```sh
npm install -g smee-client
```

### Setup AWS Dependencies

From `$REPO_ROOT/lunatrace/bsl/backend-cdk` folder, you'll need to run the following. Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your user.
```sh
DEV_USER=YOUR_USERNAME yarn run dev:cdk:deploy
```

That will run a real AWS deployment of the "dev" resources required. Once it finished, you should see something like:

```sh
 ✅  lunatrace-EtlStorage

✨  Deployment time: 180.43s

lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage.ManifestBucketName = lunatrace-alex-etlstorage-manifestbucket46c412a5-1b0kc5cys81er
lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage.ProcessManifestProcessingQueueName = lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessManifestProcessingQueue7A1F1CB2-BWVszydikZnB
lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage.ProcessRepositoryProcessingQueueName = lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessRepositoryProcessingQueueD69CAAE0-ma9VglOAlgiF
lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage.ProcessSbomProcessingQueueName = lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessSbomProcessingQueueA3A9FE69-6CG55qoQkM7q
lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage.ProcessWebhookProcessingQueueName = lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessWebhookProcessingQueue475F8047-ZzRXj42PsJAZ
lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage.SbomBucketName = lunatrace-alex-etlstorage-sbombucket8550fee8-1drqtwb7yf2dg
Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:134071937287:stack/lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage/4655a320-cb37-11ec-a2b1-02772921f86f

✨  Total time: 184.84s
```

You'll need to format those values into an env file at `$REPO/lunatrace/dev-cli/.env.dev` that looks like:

```env
S3_SBOM_BUCKET=lunatrace-alex-etlstorage-sbombucket8550fee8-1drqtwb7yf2dg
S3_MANIFEST_BUCKET=lunatrace-alex-etlstorage-manifestbucket46c412a5-1b0kc5cys81er
PROCESS_WEBHOOK_QUEUE=lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessWebhookProcessingQueue475F8047-ZzRXj42PsJAZ
PROCESS_REPOSITORY_QUEUE=lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessRepositoryProcessingQueueD69CAAE0-ma9VglOAlgiF
PROCESS_MANIFEST_QUEUE=lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessManifestProcessingQueue7A1F1CB2-BWVszydikZnB
PROCESS_SBOM_QUEUE=lunatrace-alex-EtlStorage-ProcessSbomProcessingQueueA3A9FE69-6CG55qoQkM7q
```

### Running `tmuxp`

From the `$REPO_ROOT/lunatrace/dev-cli` folder run `yarn run start` and you should see:

```
Generating tmuxp config: /home/free/code/temp/csp-test/lunatrace/bsl/generated-lunatrace-tmuxp.yaml...
<GARBAGE CLIPPED>
Starting tmuxp...
cd /home/<USER>/<PATH_TO_REPO>/lunatrace/bsl && tmuxp load /home/<USER>/<PATH_TO_REPO>/lunatrace/bsl/generated-lunatrace-tmuxp.yaml
```

Now that you have that file, you can follow that bottom line and it'll set everything up for you to run. :)

_NOTE: If you're on a Mac, you might have to swap all `sudo docker` calls with `docker` because of differences in how the OS deals with Docker._

Also, if you ever need to "kill" tmux, you must do `Control-B` and then type `:kill-session` followed by Enter to confirm.

That'll nuke the whole session and sometimes Docker Compose might get angry with you about ports the next time you start
it up, so if you accidentally have problems after you can run `sudo docker-compose down` from the `bsl` folder.

### Setting up the Database

We use Hasura to manage the database. Migrations for Oathkeeper and Hasura will be applied automatically in dev.

#### Hasura:

You should be able to pull up the Hasura console either
by running `hasura console` or going to `http://localhost:9695/`. This will show you the GraphQL server and an admin
dashboard for the database.

#### Frontend

To set up the frontend, pull the theme submodule and compile the CSS:
```sh
cd bsl/frontend
yarn run sass:pull
yarn run sass:build
```

### Re-run everything

Either kill everything in tmuxp or just restart the front-end and back-end containers after Hasura comes up.

This is important because otherwise the GraphQL code gen stuff will probably not have run, and then everything might break.

### Test flow

Open up `http://localhost:4455/` and you should hit the front-end of the app. If it's busted... go hit us up on Slack
and we'll help you sort it out.

Hopefully this works. Please improve this doc when you use it and something is broken or could be improved. Thanks!
